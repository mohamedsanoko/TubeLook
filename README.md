# TubeLook
Project that aims to recreate the aesthetic of the YouTube main page using HTML and CSS.
It replicates the visual design of the YouTube main page, including the header, search bar
, navigation menu, and video thumbnails. TubeLook is not intended to be a functional replica of Youtube, but rather a visual experiment that explores the visual desing of the
popular video-sharing platform
